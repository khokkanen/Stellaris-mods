##Cheater
Cheater is a cheat mod for Stellaris, and includes a species trait collecting all the positive modifiers from the base game, a scientist leader trait eliminating anomaly research failure and expediting exploration (with research speed boost, but please use Spark of Genius instead), and several edicts boosting various aspects of gameplay. These are not interconnected, and can be used separately. None should be usable by the AI, although more testing is required to make sure.

Empire edicts:
 - general edict adding all positive modifiers from standard game edicts
 - edicts for influence, research, resources, construction, expansion, navy, army, leaders, and population

Species trait adding all positive species modifiers form the standard game.

Scientis leader trait expediting surveying, increasing anomaly finding chance, and reducing anomaly research risk. Also increases research speed, but it's better to use standard Spark of Genius trait instead combined with research edict.

This mod doesn't overwrite any standard game files or redefine any standard traits or edicts.
